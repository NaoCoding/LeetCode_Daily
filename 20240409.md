Another easy question. My answer's complexity is O(N*K) , K = tickets[k]
* I have found out a O(N) answer. which is mathmetic solution.
```
```py
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = 0 
        while 1:
            for i in range(len(tickets)):
                if tickets[i]:
                    ans += 1
                    tickets[i] -= 1
                if i == k and tickets[k] == 0:
                    return ans
        return 0
```
