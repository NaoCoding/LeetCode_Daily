Today's question is easy, a good practice for queue data structure.
I wrote a easy queue solution with python.
```
```py
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[int], sandwiches: List[int]) -> int:
        while students.count(sandwiches[0]) > 0:
            if students[0] != sandwiches[0]:
                students.append(students.pop(0))
            else:
                students.pop(0)
                sandwiches.pop(0)
                if len(sandwiches) == 0:
                    break
        return len(students)
```
